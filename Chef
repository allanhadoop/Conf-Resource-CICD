# A typical Chef setup is comprised of three elements – your workstation, a Chef server, and nodes.

Your workstation------- a Chef server-------- nodes

# An environment is a way to map an organization’s real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using Chef server. 
Every organization begins with a single environment called the _default environment, which cannot be modified (or deleted). Additional 
environments can be created to reflect each organization’s patterns and workflow. For example, creating production, staging, testing, 
and development environments. Generally, an environment is also associated with one (or more) cookbook versions.


# A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job 
function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list. Each node can have zero (or more) roles assigned to it. 
When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then 
the contents of that role’s run-list are applied to the node’s configuration details. When a chef-client runs, it merges its own 
attributes and run-lists with those contained within each assigned role.
-----------------------------------------------------------
# A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A cookbook defines a scenario and contains everything 
that is required to support that scenario:

-Recipes that specify the resources to use and the order in which they are to be applied
-Attribute values
-File distributions
-Templates
-Extensions to Chef, such as custom resources and libraries
The chef-client uses Ruby as its reference language for creating cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL for specific 
resources.

--------------------------------------------

# Chef server acts as a central repository for your Chef code as well as for information about every node it manages.
# A node is any computer that is managed by a Chef server.
# In practice, you use Chef to manage your servers remotely, typically from a Windows, Mac OS, or Linux workstation. Although you're configuring Ubuntu in this tutorial, your workstation can be any OS you choose.
# The normal Chef workflow starts from your workstation. There you use the Chef Development Kit, or Chef DK, to write and verify your configuration policy by writing Chef code.
# From there, you upload your Chef code to theChef server and then run Chef client on your node. Your node downloads the latest code from the Chef server and runs that code to bring your node's configuration up to date. You might set up your node to check in periodically with the Chef server or update your node on demand when your configuration policy changes.

-------------------------------BELOW CODE goes on workstation or on CHEF DEVELOPMENT KIT BOX --------------------
mkdir chef-repo 
cd chef-repo 
touch hello.rb    #first simple receipe 
file '/tmp/motd' do
  content 'hello world'
end

# now apply chef-client command to apply this to nodes. Typically, chef-client downloads and runs the latest Chef code from the 
# Chef server, but in this lesson, you'll run chef-client in what's called local mode to apply Chef code that exists locally on your server.

cd chef-repo
chef-client --local-mode hello.rb   #this wil create new file motd at /tmp and then 

# Systems managed by Chef typically interact with a Chef server. So in practice, you typically omit the --local-mode argument when 
# you run chef-client to have your node check in with the Chef server to retrieve the latest cookbooks and system metadata. 
# For learning purposes, in this tutorial you use the --local-mode argument to apply a cookbook directly to see how Chef works. 
# if you run the command, nothing happens - Chef looks at the current configuration state and applies the action only if the 
# current state doesn't match the desired state

#Let's delete hello.rb by creating another receipe
cd chef-repo
sudo nano deletehello.rb
file '/tmp/motd' do
  action :delete
end
chef-client --local-mode deletehello.rb 

----->so file is one type of resource in chef world , hello.rb was a receipe(ordered series of configuration states) .A recipe is a file that holds one or more resources
----->Each resource declares what state a part of the system should be in, such as a package that should be installed, a service that should be running, or a file that should be generated.
----->These receipe are called knife.rb code.

Receipe(e.g. hello.rb code) ----> Resource(e.g. file command)--->Action (e.g.delete)

# Configure Apache webser - apt-update/package/service resources
cd chef-repo

sudo nano webserver.rb

  action :periodic
end
package 'apache2'
service 'apache2' do
  supports :status => true    #this part tells Chef that the apache2 init script supports the status message
  action [:enable, :start]
end

sudo chef-client --local-mode webserver.rb 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add a homepage to apache server installed above . 
# modify webserver.rb to add homepage code below

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content '<html>
  <body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  </body>
</html>'
end

# now curl to test if homepage works 
curl localhost 
# All code above in receipe is executing code in sequential manner...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# So problem above is receipe code for your HTML page was embedded in the Chef recipe.
# How to address above problem - use cookbook

cd chef-repo
mkdir mycookbooks
chef generate cookbook mycookbooks/learn_chef_apache2        #This tells Chef to create a cookbook named learn_chef_apache2 under the cookbooks directory.

# --runlist means it can contain multiple recipes from multiple cookbooks.The run-list lets you specify which recipes to run, and the order in which to run them
# In this example, recipe[learn_chef_apache2] is the same as specifying recipe[learn_chef_apache2::default], 
# meaning we want to run the learn_chef_apache2 cookbook's default recipe, default.rb.
--- A cookbook groups together recipes and other information in a way that is more manageable than having just recipes alone.

-----------------------------------------------------BELOW CODE goes on Chef SERVER BOX ------------------------------------
# learn how the Chef server acts as a central repository for your cookbooks and for information about your servers, or nodes
# Use AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, a managed service that runs on Amazon Web Services that includes a Chef server and Chef Automate.
# Hosted Chef and OpsWorks for Chef Automate are the fastest ways to set up a Chef server.
# Chef server knows a node's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and its platform.
# A node is any computer that is managed by a Chef server. Every node has the Chef client installed on it. 
# The Chef client talks to the Chef server. A node can be any physical or virtual machine in your network.

--some theory -
Chef Automate extends this setup by giving your operations and development teams a common platform for developing, building, 
testing, and deploying cookbooks, applications, and more. It enables multiple teams to work together on systems made up of many 
different components and services, and promotes the DevOps principles of cross-team collaboration, cooperation, and transparency.
You access Chef Automate's visibility feature through a web interface
# In this we will see, Chef server and a Chef Automate server and use Chef Automate's visibility feature to gain insight into what's 
# happening on your Chef server to better understand what happens when chef-client runs on your nodes

------Agenda
1. bring up an OpsWorks for Chef Automate installation and a node to manage.
2. write Chef code to define a policy from your workstation.
3. apply that policy to a node.
4. update your policy and apply it to a node.
5. understand how to diagnose and resolve a failed chef-client run.
6. use Chef Automate's visibility feature to visualize the status of your nodes.
7. set up chef-client to run periodically.
8. use search to run chef-client on multiple nodes.
9. use roles to define your node's behavior and attributes based on its function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. bring up an OpsWorks for Chef Automate installation and a node to manage.
so we need 2 systems and then AWS OpsWorks for chef automation 
# install the Chef DK(development kit) on your workstation so that you can manage a node remotely.
Download Chef DK system from https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk
