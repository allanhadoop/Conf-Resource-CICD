Linux - Managing Web services - Apache2
See architectual diagram 
------------About apache config file------------------------------
To improve response time, apache manages a pool of spare server processes as follows - 
1. StartServers (8) 
2. MinSpareServers(5)
3. MaxSpareServers(20)
4. ServerLimit(256)
5. MaxClients(256)

Containers - Container directives use XML-style openings/closing tags as follows - 
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow, deny 
    Allow from all 
</Directory>

Other containers include <Locatio> and <VirualHost>

--In the apache2 configuration file, if you wish to see non-comment lines then user grep
grep -v '^#' /etc/apach2/apache2.conf 

----------------------Creating content ---------------
http://example.com/foo.html   ->here foo.html is the url 
/var/www/html/foo.html   -->here /var/www/html is the document root.
See also diagram for creating content . Below is minimum home page code 
<html>
<head>
<title> The Library </title>
</head>
<body>
   <h2> Welcome to our library !</h2>
   <br />  <hr> <br />
   <img src="images/library.jpg">
</body>
</html>
------------------------------Virtual Host -------------------------
Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server or a pool of server
-wiki

Scenario - We have 2 sites ( one for east regional office and west regional office) both sites are accessed by user. so virtual host 
is going to allow user to either navigate to east or west site as requested. So here we can implement NAME BASED VIRTUAL HOSTING

see diagram for Name based virtual hosting.
How does Apache know which site to serve ---> The host field in the http request header identifies which site (virtual host to serve) 
example - 

GET http://east.example.org/HTTP /1.1 
host is east.example.org which is what is matched against the <VirtualHost> container in the apache configuration file 
See diagram to see how to configure this <VirtualHost> container in config. file

Common example of spitting out Error log and Transfer log to other folders
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName east.example.com
  DocumentRoot /var/www/html/east
  ErrorLog /var/www/apache2/east/error_log
  TransferLog /var/www/apache2/west/acces_log
</VirtualHost>

and /etc/hosts may look like below 
127.0.0.1  localhost
127.0.0.1  east.example.com
127.0.0.1  west.example.com

-----need to check where to do <VirtualHost> code in Ubuntu .. there is no sample code at apache2.conf
