# SO basically , puppet is layer above normal shell sript in netshell.. if you wish to influence any specific file or package then its
called resource type . all such scipt can be packaged as modules but there is pre-delivered modules by community normally available
via forge.net called modules.
Other than that , there are various conf files like puppet.conf , environment.conf , auth.conf, fileserver.conf etc..

Puppet uses Ruby.It's configuration. mgt tool ( Infrastructure as code)  . Reproducible set up , scalable, aligned environment for dev,test, prod
Puppet is all about to model everything — 
1. the current state of the node, 
2. the desired configuration state, 
3. the actions taken during configuration enforcement — as data: 
each node receives a catalog of resources and relationships, compares it to the current system state, and makes changes as needed to 
bring the system into compliance.
----------------------------------------
Basically , puppet .pp manifests files code is layer on top of linux scripting.. so write .pp script into node.pp and let site.pp 
import node.pp . Node.pp script can be organized by using modules whih helps to keep it clean. as shown below, user is module
then initialize using init.pp

+ modules
 + users
Read more at - https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apac
  + manifests
    - init.pp
  + files

so structure is /etc/puppet/ --> under this we have main manifest and module folders. When we create new module , create 
new init.pp and code.pp under new manifest folder under module . init.pp will invoke class and code.pp will have class code.

Now when we do puppet apply , use below syntax
puppet apply --modulepath <path until manifest> <path till site.pp of main manifest>

# To install modules from puppetlabs(forge module) 
puppet module install puppetlabs-apache ( example to install apache module)  

when we download module then it goes to .puppet folder in home directory (pwd) . each module has class( chunk of puppet code ) that 
puppet apply applies on the node.
so go to manifest folder of .puppet folder and there it wil have init.pp file where you will find class name of the module. 
plug that class name into main manifest site.pp under node default { include '<class name>': } 

You can valide above config by running - puppet parser validate site.pp 
Now, puppet apply --modulepath to .puppet folder and then <path of main manifest site.pp>

if we are using master-client set up then main manifest , node.pp, site.pp stays at master node and 
from client machine we fire command like puppet agent -t which will pull config from master and apply.

Make sure to maintain Puppetfile . https://docs.puppet.com/pe/2016.1/cmgmt_puppetfile.html. It is ruby based DSL which speify
whicch modules to be installed on each environment. so each module we install, check what we need to specify in Puppetfile from forge site
-- Create a file name Puppetfile and declare modules here with mod settings

-- High level steps -- 
1. There are two main folders one at absolte path which is /etc/puppet/manifest where you maintain site.pp and node.pp 
2. Then there is relative path at ~/.puppet/module where we typically download modules from forge.net
3. Now, we need to download module from forge.net and then install using command given at forge.net with version (if required) 
4. Before you run puppet agent -t or puppet apply site.pp , make sure to add Puppetfile at absolute path (with all declared mod as given 
in forge.net site which are dependencies)

when we run number 4 step above, puppet generates catalog . 
You will find metadata.json file under relative path module directory. so this metadata.json has dependencies listed for installing that 
module. puppet function can be called during catalog compliation and it returns the value.

- Hiera - Key-value lookup tool where Puppet data can be placed such as classes
- PuppetDB - PuppetDB is a "fast, scalable and reliable" data warehouse for Puppet.

apt-get install puppet       # On clients (nodes)
apt-get install puppetmaster # On server (master)

# From version 2 Puppet follows Semantic Versioning standards to manage versioning, with a pattern like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# Terms used in Puppet language are as follow
- Resource types
- Classes and defines
- Variables and parameters
- Nodes classification

Similar to recipe(chef .rb extension) , we have manifest(with .pp extension) in puppet
Similar to resources(files, services, apt-update etc) in Chef, we call it resources in Puppet too however we have classes that group all resources and can expose parameters that may impact their behaviors
Similar to cookbooks(combination of all recipes) in chef , here we have modules in puppet 
Since chef uses workstation or Chef developmen kit , it uses knife CLI to send recipe or cookbbok to chef server which then gets applied
at chef client, in case of puppet there is no CLI tool since facter is enough to apply manifest site.pp directly to puppet node .


Example of resource - 
type { 'title':        # type (package, service, file, user, mount)
  argument  => value,
  other_arg => value,
}
file { 'motd':
  path    => '/etc/motd',
  content => 'Tomorrow is another day',
}
service { 'httpd':
  ensure => running,
  enable => true,
}
package { 'openssh':
  ensure => present,
}
-----------Run stage in the manifest-- Manage depenencies in the resources -- Manage dependencies (BRSNS - before, require, subscribe, notify, stage)
stage { 'pre':
  before => Stage['main'],
}
or-
class { 'yum':
  stage => 'pre',
}
----------Metaparameters (managing dependencies) in the mainifest-- Manage dependencies (before, require, subscribe, notify, stage)
In a typical Package/Service/Configuration file example we want the package to be installed first, configure it and then start 
the service, eventually managing its restart if the config file changes
package { 'exim':
  before => File['exim.conf'],  
}
file { 'exim.conf':
  notify => Service['exim'],
}
service { 'exim':
}
-- This is equivalent to Package['exim'] -> File['exim.conf'] ~> Service['exim']
Below is the reverse metaparameters - 
package { 'exim':
}
file { 'exim.conf':
  require => Package['exim'],
}
service { 'exim':
  subscribe => File['exim.conf'],
}
Which is equivalent to Service['exim'] <~ File['exim.conf'] <- Package['exim']
--------------------using selector for variable assignments, case and if-else-endif statement in the manifest 
some examples of operators  - if $::osfamily == 'Debian' { [ ... ] }
----------------------
# Management of nginx service with parameters defined in module's variables
service { 'nginx':
  ensure     => $::nginx::manage_service_ensure,
  name       => $::nginx::service_name,
  enable     => $::nginx::manage_service_enable,
}

# Creation of nginx.conf with content retrieved from different sources (first found is served)
file { 'nginx.conf':
  ensure  => present,
  path    => '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf',
  source  => [
      "puppet:///modules/site/nginx.conf--${::fqdn}",
      "puppet:///modules/site/nginx.conf" ],
}

-------------## Classes are collection of resources and parameters as shown below
# All classes and parameters are placed in /etc/puppet/manifest/site.pp
class mysql (
  root_password => 'default_value',          ## This is parameter of the class
  port          => '3306',                   ## This is parameter of the class
) {
  package { 'mysql-server':                  ## Here package and services are resources of the class.
    ensure => present,
  }
  service { 'mysql':
    ensure    => running,
  }
  [...]
}
It is also possible to inherit other class - 
class puppet::server inherits mysql {
  File['/etc/puppet/puppet.conf'] {
    content => template('puppet/server/puppet.conf'),
  }
}
--------------## "defines" there are same as parameterized class shown above but these can be used multiple times with different names
It has 'definition' and 'declaration' sections as shown below - 
--Definition of a define:
define apache::virtualhost (
  $ensure   = present,
  $template = 'apache/virtualhost.conf.erb' ,
  [...] ) {

  file { "ApacheVirtualHost_${name}":
    ensure  => $ensure,
    content => template("${template}"),
  }
}
--Declaration of a define:
apache::virtualhost { 'www.example42.com':
  template => 'site/apache/www.example42.com-erb'
}
----------------------------------------------Modules 
# Just like chef cookbook, modules are used to manage an application, system's resources, a local site or more complex structures
----------------------------------------------------
Puppet client                  ------>         Puppet server
   ^^^^^
Facter runs on client          ------>         which is used by purppet server

Facter collects client system info as shown below
al$ facter
architecture => x86_64
fqdn => Macante.example42.com
hostname => Macante
interfaces => lo0,eth0
ipaddress => 10.42.42.98 
--------------------------------------------
What is node -- This is identified by puppter master using certname. So we can mention all the nodes into site.pp file 
node 'web01' , 'web02' , 'web03' {
  include apache
}
We can also inherits other nodes as shown below
node 'general' { ... }

node 'www01' inherits general { ... }
---- some therory --
So it is also possible that Puppet can query an external source to retrieve the classes and the parameters to assign to a node. 
This source is called External Node Classifier (ENC).Common ENC are Puppet DashBoard, The Foreman and Puppet Enterprise 
(where the functionality of ENC is enabled by default).
-
Hiera provides a hiera_include function that allows the inclusion of classes as defined on Hiera. 
hiera_include('classes')

The catalog is the complete list of resources, and their relationships, that the Puppet Master generates for the client.
It's the result of all the puppet code and logic that we define for a given node in our manifests and is applied on the client after it has 
been received from the master. It is stored at - 
/var/lib/puppet/client_data/catalog/$certname.json

------ some commands -- 
puppet describe
puppet resource
facter
puppet apply
-------Operational Mode 
Two types - 1. Masterless - puppet apply      2. Master / Client - puppet agent
In case 1 - Puppet code (written in manifests) is applied directly on the target system.puppet apply (generally as root).
            Puppet manifests are deployed directly on nodes and applied locally:
            puppet apply --modulepath /modules/ /manifests/file.pp
In case 2 - There are managed nodes, where Puppet client is installed. One or more Masters where Puppet server runs as a service.
            Client/Server communication is via https (port 8140).Clients certificates have to be accepted (signed) on the Master.Client and Server have to share SSL certificates. New client certificates must be signed by the Master CA
            on the client: puppet agent (generally as root) and on the server: puppet master (generally as puppet).
            A Puppet client (running as 'root') on each managed node. Client can be run as a service (default), via cron 
            (with random delays), manually or via MCollective.

Few commands related to certificats on puppter master - 
puppet cert list
puppet cert list --all
puppet cert sign <certname>

-----Puppet configuration details
puppet.conf is main configuration file. For opensource puppet it is at /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and for puppter enterprise - /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

-----Common command line parameters 
puppet agent --test # Can be abbreviate to -t
puppet agent --test --debug
puppet agent --test --noop              # Run a dry-run puppet without making any change to the system:
puppet agent --test --waitforcert 120   # Wait for certificate approval (by default 120 seconds) in the first Puppet run 
puppet describe -s <type>               # check all the types documentation 
puppet resource <type> [name]           # To interactively inspect and modify our system's resources
------------Anatomy of puppet run(pull mechanism) ---------------
puppet agent -t    # on puppet client node machine. 
--If pluginsync = true then client retrieves all extra plugins (facts, types and providers) present in modules on the server's $modulepath
--The client runs facter and send its facts to the server
--The server looks for the client's hostname (or certname, if different from the hostname) and looks into its nodes list
--If there are not syntax errors in the processed Puppet code, the server sends the catalog to the client, in PSON format.
--The client receives the catalog and starts to apply it locally
--Info - Applying configuration version '1355353107'
--At the end ot the Puppet run the client sends to the server a report of what has been changed
--The server eventually sends the report to a Report Collector

# Optimizing puppet for performance - TIPS 

- Reduce the number of resources per node
- For each resource Puppet has to serialize, deserialize, apply, report...
- Avoid use of resources for too many entities (Do manage hundreds of users with the User type)
- Limit overhead of containing classes
(A module with the openssh::package, openssh::service, openssh::configuration subclasses pattern is uselessly filled with extra resources)

- Do not use the file type to deliver too large files or binaries:
- For each file Puppet has to make a checksum to verify if it has changed
- With source => , the content of the file is retrieved with a new connection to the PuppetMaster
- With content => template() , the content is placed inside the catalog.
- Avoid too many elements in a source array for file retrieval:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Catelog - 
When configuring a node, Puppet Agent uses a document called a catalog, which it downloads from a Puppet Master. The catalog describes the 
desired state for each resource that should be managed, and may specify dependency information for resources that should be managed in a 
certain order.Puppet compiles a catalog using three main sources of configuration info:
1. Agent-provided data
2. External data
3. Puppet manifests
-------------------------------------------------------Q&A ----------------------------------------
# sOurce - http://tekslate.com/puppet-interview-questions-and-answers

- Puppet Agent(Client) sends request to Puppet Master (Server) and Puppet Master Push Configuration on Agent
- Manifests, in Puppet, are the files in which the client configuration is specified.
- Whatever the manifests we defined in modules, can call or include into other manifests. Which makes easier management of Manifests.
It helps you to push specific manifests on specific Node or Agent.
- Commands to check requests of Certificates = puppet ca list
- Commands to sign Requested Certificates = puppet ca  sign hostname-of-agent 
- Puppet Master Stores Certificates at /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/signed
- Facter - Sometime you need to write manifests on conditional expression based on agent specific data which is available through Facter. 
Facter provides information like Kernel version,Dist release, IP Address, CPU info and etc.You can defined your facter also.

- etckeeper-commit-pre: In this configuration file you can define command and scripts which executes before pushing configuration on Agent
- etckeeper-commit-post: In this configuration file you can define command and scripts which executes after pushing configuration on Agent
- Puppet kick - By default Puppet Agent request to Puppet Master after a periodic time which known as “runinterval”. Puppet Kick is a 
utility which allows you to trigger Puppet Agent from Puppet Master.
- MCollective is a powerful orchestration framework. Run actions on thousands of servers simultaneously, using existing plugins or writing 
your own.

- How to document manifest - 
The puppet language includes a simple documentation syntax, which is currently documented on the Puppet Manifest Documentation wiki page. 
The puppetdoc command uses this inline documentation to automatically generate RDoc or HTML documents for your manifests and modules.
- How to manage passwords on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora Core?
Need the Shadow Password Library, which is provided by the ruby-shadow package. The ruby-shadow library is available natively for fc6 
(and higher),
- How do all of these variables, like $operatingsystem, get set?
The variables are all set by Facter. You can get a full listing of the available variables and their values by running facter by itself 
in a shell. $facter

- Can I access environment variables with Facter?
Not directly. However, Facter reads in custom facts from a special subset of environment variables. Any environment variable with a prefix 
of FACTER_ will be converted into a fact when Facter runs

$ FACTOR_FOO="bar"
$ export FACTOR_FOO
$ facter | grep 'foo'
  foo => bar
The value of the FACTER_FOO environment variable would now be available in your Puppet manifests as $foo, and would have a value of ‘bar’. 

- Why shouldn’t I use autosign for all my clients?
It is very tempting to enable autosign for all nodes, as it cuts down on the manual steps required to bootstrap a new node .
Typically this would be done with a *.example.com or even * in the autosign.conf file.
The problem lies in the fact that the puppet master does not make a 1-1 mapping between a node and the first certificate it saw for it, 
and hence multiple certificates can map to the same node, for example:
– alice.example.com connects, gets node alice { } definition.
– bob.example.com connects with CN alice.bob.example.com, and also matches node alice { } definition.
Without autosigning, it would be apparent that bob was trying to get alice’s configuration – as the puppet cert process lists the full 
fqdn/CN presented. With autosign turned on, bob silently retrieves alice’s configuration.
