Protocol                http/https

websockets & http/2       yes

# An Application Load Balancer makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based routing, and 
can route requests to one or more ports on each EC2 
# Content-based routing allows requests to be routed to different applications behind a single load balancer.
# Each Application load balancer can have up to 10 listeners, should have at least 1 listener

# Logical grouping of targets behind the load balancer. Support for EC2 instances and Amazon ECS container instances

# Each listener can have one or more rules for routing requests to target groups. Rules consist of conditions and actions.
# When a request meets the condition of the rule, the action is taken. Conditions can be specified in path pattern format.
# Application load balancer allows for multiple services to be hosted behind a single load balancer whereas classical load balancer
# needs two 2 ELBs. 

# Auto Scaling can now scale targets within a target group. Allows for applications to be scaled independently behind the 
Application load balancer. Auto Scaling manages the scaling of each target group independently. 

# ----------------- ECS with application load balancer
Application Load Balancer is fully integrated with ECS, managing target groups, paths, and targets.
ECS automatically registers tasks with the load balancer using a dynamic port mapping

# Cloudwatch matrics to monitor health - The following metrics are now provided at the target group level, allowing for individual 
applications to be closely monitored:
• RequestCount
• HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count
• HTTPCode_Target_3XX_Count

# Logs indexed by date, but include the IP address of the load balancer node itself can be fed to S3 bucket for analysis.
