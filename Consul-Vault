Vault is designed  a tool for securely managing secrets and encrypting data in-transit. From storing credentials and API keys to 
encrypting passwords for user signups

The strength of Consul is that it is fault tolerant and highly scalable. By using Consul as a backend to Vault, you get the best of 
both. Consul is used for durable storage of encrypted data at rest and provides coordination so that Vault can be highly available 
and fault tolerant. Vault provides the higher level policy management, secret leasing, audit logging, and automatic revocation.
