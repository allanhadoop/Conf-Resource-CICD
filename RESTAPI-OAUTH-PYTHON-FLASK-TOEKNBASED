Example - consider a website or application that asks you for permission to access your Facebook account and post something to your 
timeline. In this example you are the resource holder (you own your Facebook timeline), the third party application is the consumer and 
Facebook is the provider. Even if you grant access and the consumer application writes to your timeline, it never sees your Facebook login 
information. This usage of OAuth does not apply to a client/server RESTful API. Something like this would only make sense if your RESTful 
API can be accessed by third party applications (consumers).
